## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive operational security procedures for the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine. It outlines the day-to-day security operations, incident response procedures, access management, and compliance activities required to maintain the security posture of the system.

As a financial system handling sensitive data and calculations, security is a critical aspect of operations. These procedures are designed to ensure that the security controls implemented in the system architecture are properly maintained and operated.

### Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide clear guidance on security operations for the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine. It covers:

- Day-to-day security operations
- Security incident response procedures
- Access management and authentication
- Key and credential management
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Compliance activities and reporting
- Vulnerability management

This document is intended for operations teams, security personnel, and on-call engineers responsible for maintaining the security of the system.

### Security Principles
All security operations are guided by the following core principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls to prevent single points of failure
- **Least Privilege**: Users and services have only the minimum permissions necessary
- **Secure by Default**: Security is built into operations, not added as an afterthought
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is protected both at rest and in transit
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All security-relevant events are logged for audit and investigation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Security operations meet or exceed relevant financial industry regulations

These principles should inform all security-related decisions and activities.

### Roles and Responsibilities
The following roles have specific security responsibilities:

- **Operations Team**: Day-to-day security operations, monitoring, and first-level incident response
- **Security Team**: Security architecture, policy development, incident investigation, and compliance
- **Development Team**: Secure coding practices, security testing, and vulnerability remediation
- **Management**: Resource allocation, risk acceptance, and overall security governance

Each role has specific responsibilities detailed in the relevant sections of this document.

## Access Management
Access management procedures ensure that only authorized individuals and systems can access the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine and its components.

### User Access Management
These procedures apply to human users accessing the system for administration, development, or support purposes.

**User Onboarding:**
1. Access requests must be submitted via the access management system
2. Requests must include business justification and required access level
3. Approvals must be obtained from the user's manager and the system owner
4. Access must be provisioned according to the least privilege principle
5. Initial credentials must be securely communicated to the user
6. Users must change initial passwords on first login

**Access Review:**
1. User access must be reviewed quarterly
2. Reviews must verify continued business need for access
3. Reviews must verify appropriate access levels
4. Unnecessary or excessive access must be removed
5. Review results must be documented and retained

**User Offboarding:**
1. HR must notify the operations team of user departures
2. Access must be revoked within 24 hours of departure
3. Shared accounts must have passwords changed
4. Access revocation must be documented and verified
5. Periodic audits must confirm no orphaned accounts exist

```
# Example user access review query

SELECT 
    u.username, 
    u.last_login, 
    u.created_at,
    r.role_name,
    string_agg(p.permission_name, ', ') as permissions
FROM 
    users u
JOIN 
    user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id
JOIN 
    roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
JOIN 
    role_permissions rp ON r.id = rp.role_id
JOIN 
    permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.id
GROUP BY 
    u.username, u.last_login, u.created_at, r.role_name
ORDER BY 
    u.last_login DESC;
```

### API Key Management
API keys are the primary authentication method for client applications. Proper management is critical for system security.

**API Key Generation:**
1. API keys must be generated using the approved key generation utility
2. Keys must be at least 32 characters in length
3. Keys must be cryptographically random
4. Keys must be associated with a specific client ID
5. Keys must have an expiration date (maximum 90 days)
6. Key metadata must include rate limit tier and permissions

**API Key Distribution:**
1. New API keys must be distributed via secure channels
2. Keys must be transmitted to pre-verified client contacts only
3. Keys must be transmitted separately from their metadata
4. Key transmission must use encrypted communications
5. Recipients must confirm receipt of keys

**API Key Rotation:**
1. API keys must be rotated at least every 90 days
2. Rotation schedule must be communicated to clients in advance
3. New keys must be distributed at least 14 days before old keys expire
4. Old keys must be revoked after the transition period
5. Emergency rotations must follow the incident response procedure

**API Key Revocation:**
1. Compromised keys must be revoked immediately
2. Unused keys (no activity for 30 days) must be revoked
3. Keys for terminated client relationships must be revoked
4. Revocation must be logged and documented
5. Clients must be notified of revocation when appropriate

```
# Generate a new API key using the utility

# Using the CLI tool
python -m scripts.generate_api_key --client-id CLIENT_ID --rate-limit 60 --expiry-days 90

# Using the API
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id": "CLIENT_ID", "rate_limit": 60, "expiry_days": 90}' \
  https://api.example.com/admin/api-keys

# Revoke an API key
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/admin/api-keys/KEY_ID
```

### Service Account Management
Service accounts are used for service-to-service authentication and automated processes.

**Service Account Creation:**
1. Service accounts must be created for specific service functions
2. Each service account must have a clear purpose documented
3. Service accounts must follow the naming convention: svc-{service}-{function}
4. Service accounts must be assigned the minimum necessary permissions
5. Service account creation must be approved by the security team

**Service Account Credentials:**
1. Service account credentials must be stored in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Credentials must be rotated automatically every 30 days
3. Credentials must never be stored in code or configuration files
4. Credential access must be logged and monitored
5. Applications must retrieve credentials at runtime

**Service Account Review:**
1. Service accounts must be reviewed quarterly
2. Reviews must verify continued need for the service account
3. Reviews must verify appropriate permission levels
4. Unused service accounts must be disabled
5. Review results must be documented and retained

```
# Create a service account in Kubernetes
kubectl create serviceaccount svc-calculation-api

# Create a role with minimum permissions
kubectl create role calculation-api-role --verb=get,list --resource=secrets,configmaps

# Bind the role to the service account
kubectl create rolebinding calculation-api-binding --role=calculation-api-role --serviceaccount=default:svc-calculation-api

# Store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name svc-calculation-api-credentials \
  --secret-string '{"username":"svc-calculation-api","password":"GENERATED_PASSWORD"}' \
  --description "Service account for Calculation API" \
  --tags Key=Service,Value=CalculationAPI
```

### Role-Based Access Control
Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to manage permissions within the system.

**Role Definitions:**

| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Client | Standard API consumer | Calculate fees, view rates for assigned tickers |
| Admin | System administrator | All permissions including configuration changes |
| Auditor | Compliance reviewer | View-only access to rates and audit logs |
| System | Internal services | System-level integration permissions |
| Operations | Operations team | Monitoring, troubleshooting, incident response |
| Security | Security team | Security monitoring, incident investigation |

**Role Assignment:**
1. Users must be assigned roles based on job responsibilities
2. Role assignments must follow the least privilege principle
3. Role assignments must be documented and approved
4. Users requiring multiple roles must be assigned the minimum necessary
5. Temporary role elevations must be time-limited and logged

**Role Review:**
1. Role definitions must be reviewed annually
2. Reviews must verify roles align with business needs
3. Reviews must verify appropriate permission groupings
4. Unnecessary permissions must be removed from roles
5. Review results must be documented and retained

```
# Example role definition in PostgreSQL

CREATE ROLE client_role;
GRANT SELECT ON rates TO client_role;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION calculate_fee TO client_role;

CREATE ROLE admin_role;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO admin_role;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO admin_role;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO admin_role;

CREATE ROLE auditor_role;
GRANT SELECT ON rates TO auditor_role;
GRANT SELECT ON audit_log TO auditor_role;
GRANT SELECT ON api_keys TO auditor_role;
```

## Credential Management
Proper management of credentials is essential for maintaining the security of the system.

### Credential Storage
All credentials must be securely stored to prevent unauthorized access.

**Approved Storage Locations:**
1. AWS Secrets Manager - For application credentials, API keys, and service accounts
2. AWS Parameter Store - For configuration parameters with lower sensitivity
3. HashiCorp Vault - Alternative for credential storage in specific environments
4. Kubernetes Secrets - For credentials used within Kubernetes pods

**Prohibited Storage Locations:**
1. Source code repositories
2. Configuration files
3. Environment variables in deployment manifests
4. Shared documents or wikis
5. Chat systems or email
6. Local workstations

**Storage Requirements:**
1. All credentials must be encrypted at rest
2. Access to credential storage must be strictly controlled
3. Access to credentials must be logged and monitored
4. Credentials must be versioned to support rotation
5. Credential storage must be backed up securely

```
# Store a credential in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name db-credentials \
  --secret-string '{"username":"dbuser","password":"COMPLEX_PASSWORD"}' \
  --description "Database credentials for Borrow Rate Engine" \
  --tags Key=Application,Value=BorrowRateEngine

# Store a credential in Kubernetes Secrets
kubectl create secret generic db-credentials \
  --from-literal=username=dbuser \
  --from-literal=password=COMPLEX_PASSWORD

# Reference a secret in a Kubernetes deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-gateway
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api-gateway
        env:
        - name: DB_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: username
        - name: DB_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: password
```

### Credential Rotation
Regular rotation of credentials reduces the risk of credential compromise.

**Rotation Schedule:**

| Credential Type | Rotation Frequency | Responsible Team | Notification Period |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| API Keys | 90 days | Operations | 14 days |
| Database Credentials | 90 days | Operations | N/A |
| Service Account Credentials | 30 days | Operations | N/A |
| TLS Certificates | 1 year | Security | 30 days |
| Encryption Keys | 1 year | Security | N/A |
| Admin Credentials | 90 days | Security | 7 days |

**Rotation Procedures:**
1. Generate new credentials using approved methods
2. Deploy new credentials to credential storage
3. Update applications to use new credentials
4. Verify functionality with new credentials
5. Revoke old credentials after transition period
6. Document rotation in the credential management system

**Emergency Rotation:**
1. Immediately generate new credentials
2. Deploy new credentials to credential storage
3. Update applications to use new credentials
4. Revoke old credentials immediately
5. Verify functionality with new credentials
6. Document emergency rotation and reason

```
# Rotate a secret in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
  --secret-id db-credentials \
  --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:RotateDBCredentials

# Configure automatic rotation
aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
  --secret-id db-credentials \
  --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:RotateDBCredentials \
  --rotation-rules '{"AutomaticallyAfterDays": 90}'

# Rotate a TLS certificate using cert-manager in Kubernetes
kubectl annotate certificate api-gateway-tls cert-manager.io/renew="true"
```

### Encryption Key Management
Encryption keys must be properly managed to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.

**Key Hierarchy:**
1. Master Key - AWS KMS Customer Master Key (CMK)
2. Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) - Generated and protected by the Master Key
3. Application-specific keys - Generated for specific encryption needs

**Key Management Procedures:**
1. Master keys must be managed in AWS KMS
2. Key usage must be logged and monitored
3. Keys must be rotated according to the rotation schedule
4. Old key versions must be maintained for decryption of existing data
5. Key access must be strictly controlled

**Key Backup and Recovery:**
1. Master keys must be protected by AWS KMS backup mechanisms
2. Key metadata must be documented and securely stored
3. Recovery procedures must be tested regularly
4. Key recovery must require multi-person authorization
5. Recovery events must be logged and audited

```
# Create a KMS master key
aws kms create-key \
  --description "Master key for Borrow Rate Engine" \
  --tags TagKey=Application,TagValue=BorrowRateEngine

# Enable automatic key rotation
aws kms enable-key-rotation \
  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

# Generate a data encryption key
aws kms generate-data-key \
  --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
  --key-spec AES_256

# Encrypt data using a data encryption key
# Python example
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# The key returned from KMS generate-data-key (Plaintext field)
key = b'...'  
cipher = Fernet(key)
encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(b'sensitive data')
```

### Credential Compromise Response
In the event of a suspected or confirmed credential compromise, immediate action is required.

**Indicators of Compromise:**
1. Unusual access patterns or times
2. Access from unexpected locations
3. Unauthorized actions or permission violations
4. Unexpected credential usage
5. Security tool alerts

**Response Procedures:**
1. Immediately revoke the compromised credentials
2. Generate new credentials using emergency rotation procedures
3. Investigate the scope and impact of the compromise
4. Identify and address the root cause of the compromise
5. Document the incident and response actions
6. Notify affected parties as required

**Post-Incident Actions:**
1. Review credential management practices
2. Implement additional controls if needed
3. Update monitoring and alerting rules
4. Conduct training if human error was involved
5. Update documentation and procedures based on lessons learned

```
# Revoke an API key immediately
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/admin/api-keys/COMPROMISED_KEY_ID

# Rotate a secret immediately in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --secret-id compromised-credential \
  --secret-string '{"username":"dbuser","password":"NEW_COMPLEX_PASSWORD"}'

# Disable a user account
aws iam update-user \
  --user-name compromised-user \
  --no-password-reset-required

aws iam delete-login-profile \
  --user-name compromised-user
```

## Security Monitoring

        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Incident Response
Security incident response procedures ensure that security incidents are handled effectively and efficiently.

### Security Incident Classification
Security incidents are classified based on their severity and impact.

**Severity Levels:**

| Severity | Description | Examples | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Critical | Confirmed security breach with data exposure or system compromise | • Data breach with PII exposure<br>• System compromise with unauthorized access<br>• Widespread authentication bypass | 15 minutes |
| High | Likely security incident with potential for significant impact | • Suspected unauthorized access<br>• Targeted attack attempts<br>• Credential compromise | 30 minutes |
| Medium | Security event requiring investigation | • Multiple failed login attempts<br>• Unusual access patterns<br>• Policy violations | 2 hours |
| Low | Minor security concern or policy violation | • Isolated failed login attempts<br>• Weak password usage<br>• Unpatched non-critical vulnerabilities | 8 hours |

**Impact Assessment:**
1. Data sensitivity - What type of data is potentially affected?
2. System criticality - How critical is the affected system?
3. Scope - How widespread is the incident?
4. Business impact - What is the potential business impact?
5. Regulatory implications - Are there regulatory reporting requirements?

### Security Incident Response Process
The security incident response process provides a structured approach to handling security incidents.

**1. Detection and Reporting:**
- Incidents may be detected through monitoring, alerts, or reports
- All suspected security incidents must be reported immediately
- Initial reports should include as much detail as possible
- Reports should be made to the security team via the incident management system

**2. Triage and Assessment:**
- Security team assesses the incident severity and impact
- Initial containment measures are implemented if necessary
- Incident response team is assembled based on severity
- Incident is documented in the incident management system

**3. Containment:**
- Immediate actions to limit the impact of the incident
- Isolation of affected systems if necessary
- Blocking of malicious IP addresses or users
- Revocation of compromised credentials
- Preservation of evidence for investigation

**4. Investigation:**
- Detailed analysis of the incident
- Collection and analysis of logs and other evidence
- Determination of the root cause
- Assessment of the full scope and impact
- Documentation of findings

**5. Remediation:**
- Implementation of corrective actions
- Removal of unauthorized access or malicious code
- Restoration of systems to secure state
- Implementation of additional security controls
- Verification that the incident has been resolved

**6. Recovery:**
- Restoration of normal operations
- Verification of system integrity and functionality
- Monitoring for any recurring issues
- Return of systems to production

**7. Post-Incident Activities:**
- Detailed documentation of the incident
- Root cause analysis and lessons learned
- Implementation of preventive measures
- Updates to security controls and procedures
- Reporting to management and regulators if required

### Security Incident Response Team
The Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) is responsible for handling security incidents.

**Team Composition:**
1. Incident Commander - Coordinates the overall response
2. Security Lead - Provides security expertise and guidance
3. Technical Lead - Leads technical investigation and remediation
4. Communications Lead - Handles internal and external communications
5. Legal Counsel - Provides legal guidance and regulatory advice
6. Subject Matter Experts - Provide specialized expertise as needed

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

| Role | Responsibilities | Authority |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Incident Commander | • Coordinate overall response<br>• Make key decisions<br>• Allocate resources<br>• Track progress<br>• Report to management | • Declare incidents<br>• Escalate to management<br>• Authorize containment actions |
| Security Lead | • Assess security implications<br>• Guide investigation<br>• Recommend security controls<br>• Ensure evidence preservation<br>• Coordinate with external security resources | • Define investigation scope<br>• Recommend containment actions<br>• Approve security measures |
| Technical Lead | • Lead technical investigation<br>• Implement technical remediation<br>• Analyze logs and evidence<br>• Restore systems<br>• Document technical details | • Direct technical resources<br>• Implement technical changes<br>• Approve system restoration |
