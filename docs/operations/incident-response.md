# Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance for incident response procedures for the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine. It outlines standardized processes for detecting, classifying, responding to, and recovering from various types of incidents that may affect the system.

Effective incident response is critical for minimizing the impact of incidents on system availability, data integrity, and business operations. This document serves as the primary reference for all incident response activities.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide clear guidance on incident response for the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine. It covers:

- Incident detection and classification
- Escalation procedures and communication protocols
- Roles and responsibilities during incidents
- Incident response procedures for different incident types
- Recovery procedures
- Post-incident activities

This document applies to all incidents affecting the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine, including service outages, performance degradation, security incidents, and data integrity issues.

## Incident Response Principles

All incident response activities are guided by the following core principles:

- **Rapid Response**: Incidents must be addressed quickly to minimize impact
- **Clear Communication**: Regular and clear communication throughout the incident
- **Appropriate Escalation**: Timely escalation to the right teams and individuals
- **Methodical Investigation**: Structured approach to incident investigation
- **Effective Mitigation**: Quick implementation of mitigation measures
- **Thorough Resolution**: Complete resolution of the root cause
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from incidents to prevent recurrence

These principles should inform all incident response activities.

## Incident Response Lifecycle

The incident response lifecycle consists of the following phases:

1. **Preparation**: Establishing and maintaining incident response capabilities
2. **Detection and Analysis**: Identifying and analyzing potential incidents
3. **Containment**: Limiting the impact of the incident
4. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident
5. **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation
6. **Post-Incident Activity**: Learning from the incident

This document provides detailed procedures for each phase of the incident response lifecycle.

# Incident Classification

Proper classification of incidents is essential for determining the appropriate response level, escalation path, and communication strategy.

## Severity Levels

Incidents are classified into four severity levels based on their impact on the system and business operations:

**P1 (Critical):**
- Complete system outage or unavailability
- >50% of calculations or requests failing
- Data integrity issues affecting financial calculations
- Security breach with data exposure
- Direct revenue impact

**P2 (High):**
- Significant performance degradation (>250ms latency)
- 10-50% of calculations or requests failing
- Component failure with partial system impact
- Security incidents without confirmed data exposure
- Indirect revenue impact

**P3 (Medium):**
- Minor performance degradation (100-250ms latency)
- 1-10% of calculations or requests failing
- Non-critical component issues
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Limited user impact

**P4 (Low):**
- Cosmetic issues
- Isolated errors affecting few users
- Minor configuration issues
- Non-customer impacting problems
- Documentation issues

The incident severity determines response time, escalation path, and communication frequency.

```
# Example incident severity classification script

#!/bin/bash
# Quick script to classify incident severity based on metrics

# Get error rate
ERROR_RATE=$(curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=sum(rate(http_requests_total{namespace="borrow-rate-engine",status=~"[45].."}[5m]))/sum(rate(http_requests_total{namespace="borrow-rate-engine"}[5m])) | jq '.data.result[0].value[1]' -r)

# Get latency (p95)
LATENCY=$(curl -s http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=histogram_quantile(0.95,sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{namespace="borrow-rate-engine"}[5m]))by(le)) | jq '.data.result[0].value[1]' -r)

# Classify incident
if (( $(echo "$ERROR_RATE > 0.5" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "P1 - Critical: Error rate above 50%"
elif (( $(echo "$ERROR_RATE > 0.1" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "P2 - High: Error rate between 10-50%"
elif (( $(echo "$ERROR_RATE > 0.01" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "P3 - Medium: Error rate between 1-10%"
else
  echo "P4 - Low: Error rate below 1%"
fi

if (( $(echo "$LATENCY > 0.25" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "P2 - High: Latency above 250ms"
elif (( $(echo "$LATENCY > 0.1" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "P3 - Medium: Latency between 100-250ms"
fi
```

## Incident Types

Incidents are categorized by type to guide the response approach and team involvement:

**Service Outage:**
- Complete system unavailability
- Critical component failure
- Infrastructure failure

**Performance Degradation:**
- Slow response times
- Increased latency
- Reduced throughput

**Security Incident:**
- Unauthorized access
- Data breach
- API key compromise
- Malicious activity

**Data Integrity:**
- Incorrect calculations
- Data corruption
- Inconsistent data

**External Dependency:**
- External API failures
- Third-party service outages
- Network connectivity issues

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloud provider issues
- Network failures
- Hardware failures
- Capacity issues

Incidents may fall into multiple categories. The primary category should be determined based on the most significant impact.

## Impact Assessment

Impact assessment evaluates the effect of the incident on business operations and users:

**Business Impact:**
- **Critical**: Direct impact on revenue or regulatory compliance
- **High**: Significant impact on client operations
- **Medium**: Limited impact on client operations
- **Low**: Minimal business impact

**User Impact:**
- **Widespread**: Affecting all or most users
- **Significant**: Affecting multiple clients or user groups
- **Limited**: Affecting a small number of users
- **Minimal**: Affecting very few users or no user impact

**Functional Impact:**
- **Complete**: All system functionality affected
- **Major**: Core functionality affected
- **Partial**: Some functionality affected
- **Minor**: Non-critical functionality affected

The impact assessment helps prioritize incidents and determine the appropriate response level.

# Incident Response Process

This section outlines the standard incident response process from detection to resolution.

## Detection and Reporting

Incidents may be detected through various channels:

**Automated Detection:**
- Monitoring alerts from Prometheus, Grafana, or other monitoring systems
- Log analysis alerts from Loki or other log management systems
- Health check failures
- Automated testing failures

**Manual Detection:**
- User reports via support tickets
- Team member observations
- Client escalations
- Scheduled testing or audits

**Reporting Process:**
1. When an incident is detected, it should be reported immediately
2. For automated alerts, the on-call engineer is automatically notified
3. For manual detection, report the incident through the appropriate channel:
   - During business hours: Report in #operations Slack channel
   - Outside business hours: Call the on-call phone number
4. Provide as much detail as possible about the incident
5. The on-call engineer will acknowledge and begin initial assessment

```
# Example monitoring alert configuration in Prometheus

groups:
- name: service_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0.01
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High error rate detected
      description: Error rate is above 1% for 5 minutes
      runbook_url: https://wiki.example.com/runbooks/high_error_rate

  - alert: APIHighLatency
    expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 0.25
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: High API latency detected
      description: 95th percentile latency is above 250ms for 5 minutes
      runbook_url: https://wiki.example.com/runbooks/high_latency

  - alert: ServiceDown
    expr: up{job=~"api-gateway|calculation-service|data-service"} == 0
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: Service is down
      description: {{ $labels.job }} service is down
      runbook_url: https://wiki.example.com/runbooks/service_down
```

## Initial Assessment and Triage

Once an incident is reported, the on-call engineer performs initial assessment and triage:

**Initial Assessment Steps:**
1. Acknowledge the incident alert or report
2. Gather basic information about the incident
3. Verify the incident is real (not a false alarm)
4. Assess the scope and impact
5. Determine the severity level (P1-P4)
6. Identify affected components and services

**Triage Actions:**
1. Create an incident record in the incident management system
2. Assign an incident ID
3. Determine if immediate escalation is needed
4. Initiate communication protocols based on severity
5. Create an incident-specific Slack channel (#incident-{incident-id})
6. Begin initial troubleshooting

**Documentation Requirements:**
1. Incident ID and timestamp
2. Severity classification and justification
3. Affected services and components
4. Impact assessment
5. Initial observations and symptoms
6. Actions taken during initial assessment

```
