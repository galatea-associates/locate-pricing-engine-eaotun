# Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for testing the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine. It covers all aspects of the testing strategy, including unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security testing.

The testing framework is designed to ensure that the system meets its functional requirements, performance targets, and security standards. Given the financial nature of the system, particular attention is paid to calculation accuracy, data integrity, and system resilience.

## Testing Framework Overview

The testing framework for the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine is organized into several categories, each with its own purpose and approach:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the correct interaction between system components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Verify the complete system behavior under realistic conditions
- **Performance Tests**: Verify the system meets its performance requirements
- **Load Tests**: Verify the system's behavior under various load conditions
- **Security Tests**: Verify the system's security controls and identify vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Tests**: Verify the system meets regulatory requirements

Each test category has its own directory structure, configuration, and execution approach, as detailed in the following sections.

## Test Directory Structure

The testing framework is organized into the following directory structure:

```
src/
├── backend/
│   └── tests/           # Unit tests for backend components

    └── requirements.txt # Test dependencies
```

This structure separates different test types while providing shared utilities and configuration where appropriate.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation, ensuring that each function, class, or module behaves as expected. For the Borrow Rate & Locate Fee Pricing Engine, unit tests are particularly important for the calculation logic, which must be precise and accurate.

### Unit Test Location

Unit tests are located in the `src/backend/tests/` directory and are organized to mirror the structure of the application code:

```
src/backend/tests/
├── api/              # Tests for API endpoints
├── services/         # Tests for service layer components
│   ├── calculation/  # Tests for calculation services
│   ├── data/         # Tests for data services
│   ├── external/     # Tests for external API clients
│   └── cache/        # Tests for caching services
├── db/               # Tests for database operations
└── utils/            # Tests for utility functions
```

### Unit Test Framework

Unit tests use the pytest framework with the following key components:

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **requests-mock**: Mocking HTTP requests
- **fakeredis**: In-memory Redis implementation for testing cache

### Writing Unit Tests

When writing unit tests, follow these guidelines:

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
2. **Mocking Dependencies**: Use mocks for external dependencies (databases, APIs, etc.)
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for 100% coverage of calculation logic and 90%+ overall
4. **Edge Cases**: Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
5. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names that indicate what is being tested

### Example Unit Test

```python
# Example unit test for borrow rate calculation
def test_calculate_borrow_rate_with_volatility_adjustment():
    # Arrange
    ticker = "AAPL"
    api_rate = 0.05  # 5% base rate
    volatility_index = 25.0  # VIX at 25
    event_risk = 2  # Low event risk
    
    # Mock dependencies
    mock_api_client.get_sec_lend_rate.return_value = api_rate
    mock_data_service.get_volatility.return_value = volatility_index
    mock_data_service.get_event_risk.return_value = event_risk
    
    # Act
    result = calculation_service.calculate_borrow_rate(ticker)
    
    # Assert
    expected = 0.05 * (1 + (25.0 * 0.01) + (2/10 * 0.05))
    assert result == pytest.approx(expected)
```

### Running Unit Tests

- **Verification**: Use a known good API key to verify authentication

#### Test Timeouts

- **Issue**: Tests fail due to timeouts
- **Solution**: Increase TEST_TIMEOUT value in configuration
- **Verification**: Run tests with increased timeout and verbose logging

#### Mock Server Issues

- **Issue**: Mock servers not responding or returning incorrect data
- **Solution**: Ensure mock servers are running with `docker-compose ps`
- **Verification**: Check mock server logs for errors

#### Data Inconsistencies

- **Issue**: Tests fail due to unexpected data
- **Solution**: Reset test data with `scripts/clean_test_data.py`
- **Verification**: Verify test data state after reset

#### Port Conflicts

- **Issue**: Services fail to start due to port conflicts
- **Solution**: Change port configurations in `.env.test` files
- **Verification**: Check for listening ports with `netstat -tuln`

#### Database Connection Errors

- **Issue**: Unable to connect to test database
- **Solution**: Ensure test database is running and accessible
- **Verification**: Use database client to connect directly

### Debugging Techniques

#### Verbose Logging

Enable verbose logging for detailed information:

```bash
pytest -xvs path/to/test_file.py
```

#### Debugging with PDB

Use Python's debugger to step through test execution:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # Add this line where you want to break
```

Or run pytest with the `--pdb` flag to enter the debugger on test failure:

```bash
pytest --pdb path/to/test_file.py
```

#### Inspecting Test Environment

Inspect the test environment to verify configuration:

```bash
# Print environment variables
python -c "import os; print(dict(os.environ))"

# Check Docker containers
docker-compose ps

# Check logs
docker-compose logs service_name
```

#### Isolating Test Failures

Run specific tests to isolate failures:

```bash
# Run a specific test function
pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name -v

# Run tests matching a pattern
pytest -k "pattern" -v
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter persistent issues:

1. Check the test documentation in the relevant README files
2. Review the technical specifications for requirements and expected behavior
