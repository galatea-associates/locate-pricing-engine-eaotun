```

Key deployment considerations:

1. **High Availability**: Critical components (Prometheus, Alertmanager) are deployed with multiple replicas across availability zones
2. **Persistent Storage**: Prometheus uses persistent volumes for metric storage
3. **Object Storage**: Loki and Tempo use S3 for long-term storage
4. **Resource Allocation**: Each component has appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits
5. **Network Policies**: Restrict communication between monitoring components
6. **Service Accounts**: Least privilege access for monitoring components

### Data Flow

The monitoring data flows through the system as follows:

1. **Metrics Flow**:
   - Application services expose Prometheus metrics endpoints
   - Prometheus scrapes metrics at configured intervals (15s default)
   - Metrics are stored in Prometheus TSDB
   - Alertmanager evaluates alert rules against metrics
   - Grafana queries Prometheus for dashboard visualization

2. **Logs Flow**:
   - Application services write logs to stdout/stderr
   - Fluent Bit collects logs from container stdout/stderr
   - Logs are parsed, labeled, and forwarded to Loki
   - Loki indexes and stores logs
   - Grafana queries Loki for log visualization

3. **Traces Flow**:
   - Application services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry
   - Traces are sent to the OpenTelemetry Collector
   - Collector processes and forwards traces to Tempo
   - Tempo indexes and stores traces
   - Grafana queries Tempo for trace visualization

4. **Alerts Flow**:
   - Prometheus evaluates alert rules against metrics
   - Firing alerts are sent to Alertmanager
   - Alertmanager groups, deduplicates, and routes alerts
   - Notifications are sent to appropriate channels (PagerDuty, Slack, Email)

This integrated data flow enables correlation between metrics, logs, and traces for effective troubleshooting.

### Configuration Management

Monitoring configurations are managed as code in the repository:

- **Prometheus**: `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus-config.yaml`
- **Alertmanager**: `infrastructure/monitoring/alertmanager-config.yaml`
- **Loki**: `infrastructure/monitoring/loki-config.yaml`
- **Tempo**: `infrastructure/monitoring/tempo-config.yaml`
- **Grafana**: `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana-dashboards.yaml`

Changes to these configurations follow the standard pull request and review process. After approval, changes are applied through the CI/CD pipeline.

Key configuration principles:

1. **Version Control**: All configurations are version-controlled
2. **Environment-specific Overrides**: Base configurations with environment-specific overrides
3. **Secret Management**: Sensitive values (API keys, credentials) managed through Kubernetes secrets
4. **Validation**: Configuration validation in CI/CD pipeline
5. **Documentation**: Inline comments explaining configuration choices

## Metrics Collection

This section describes the metrics collected by the monitoring system, their significance, and how they are used for monitoring and alerting.

### Metric Types

The monitoring system collects the following types of metrics:

1. **System Metrics**: Hardware and OS-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
2. **Kubernetes Metrics**: Cluster, node, and pod metrics
3. **Application Metrics**: Custom metrics specific to the pricing engine
4. **Database Metrics**: PostgreSQL and Redis performance metrics
5. **External API Metrics**: Performance and availability of external dependencies
6. **Business Metrics**: Financial and operational metrics specific to the domain

Metrics are collected using various exporters and instrumentation libraries, with a focus on standardization and consistency across all components.

### Core Application Metrics

The following core application metrics are collected from all services:

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Labels |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|
| http_requests_total | Counter | Total number of HTTP requests | method, path, status, service |
| http_request_duration_seconds | Histogram | HTTP request duration in seconds | method, path, service |

- `request_validation_errors_total`: Request validation errors by type

**Calculation Service Metrics:**
- `calculation_total`: Total number of calculations performed by type
- `calculation_duration_seconds`: Duration of calculations in seconds
- `calculation_fee_amount`: Distribution of fee amounts
- `calculation_errors_total`: Calculation errors by type

**Data Service Metrics:**
- `external_api_requests_total`: External API requests by API and status
- `external_api_request_duration_seconds`: External API request duration
- `database_query_duration_seconds`: Database query duration by query type

These service-specific metrics enable detailed monitoring and troubleshooting of each component.

### Business Metrics

Business metrics provide insights into the financial and operational aspects of the system:

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Labels |
|------------|------|-------------|--------|
| borrow_rate | Gauge | Current borrow rate for a ticker | ticker, borrow_status |
| calculation_position_value | Histogram | Distribution of position values in calculations | client_id |
| calculation_loan_days | Histogram | Distribution of loan days in calculations | client_id |
| calculation_fee_amount | Histogram | Distribution of fee amounts in calculations | client_id |
| fallback_usage_total | Counter | Number of times fallback mechanisms were used | type, ticker |
| client_requests_total | Counter | Total requests by client | client_id, endpoint |

These business metrics enable monitoring of key financial indicators, client usage patterns, and system effectiveness.

### SLA Metrics

SLA metrics are derived from core metrics to track compliance with service level agreements:

| SLA Metric | Calculation | Target | Warning | Critical |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|----------|
| Availability | success_requests / total_requests | >99.95% | <99.9% | <99.8% |
| Response Time (p95) | http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"} | <100ms | >150ms | >250ms |
| Calculation Time (p95) | calculation_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"} | <50ms | >75ms | >100ms |
| Error Rate | error_requests / total_requests | <0.1% | >0.5% | >1% |
| External API Success | successful_api_calls / total_api_calls | >99.5% | <99% | <98% |

These SLA metrics are prominently displayed on dashboards and used for alerting to ensure the system meets its performance requirements.

### Metric Cardinality Management

To prevent excessive cardinality in metrics, which can impact Prometheus performance, the following strategies are implemented:

1. **Label Limitation**: Restrict labels to essential dimensions
2. **Label Value Constraints**: Limit high-cardinality label values (e.g., client IDs, request IDs)
3. **Metric Aggregation**: Pre-aggregate metrics where appropriate
4. **Metric Relabeling**: Use Prometheus relabeling to control cardinality
5. **Histogram Buckets**: Use appropriate bucket definitions for histograms

Example of controlled histogram buckets for response time:
```yaml
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.005"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.01"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.025"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.25"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.5"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="2.5"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="5"}
http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="10"}
```

## Log Aggregation

This section describes the logging strategy, implementation, and how logs are used for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Logging Strategy

The system implements a structured logging approach with consistent formats across all services:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Log Sources"
        App[Application Logs]
        Sys[System Logs]
        Audit[Audit Logs]
        Access[Access Logs]
    end
    
    subgraph "Collection"
        Fluent[Fluent Bit Agents]
    end
    
    subgraph "Processing"
        Loki[Loki]
        Rules[Log Processing Rules]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage"
        Hot[Hot Storage - 90 days]
        Cold[Cold Storage - 7 years]
    end
    
    subgraph "Analysis"
        Grafana[Grafana]
        LogQL[LogQL Queries]
        Alerts[Log-based Alerts]
    end
    
    App --> Fluent
    Sys --> Fluent
    Audit --> Fluent
    Access --> Fluent
    
    Fluent --> Loki
    Loki --> Rules
    
    Loki --> Hot
    Rules --> Audit?
    Audit? -->|Yes| Cold
    Audit? -->|No| Hot
    
    Hot --> Grafana
    Cold --> Grafana
    Loki --> LogQL
    LogQL --> Alerts
```

Key aspects of the logging strategy:

1. **Structured Logging**: All logs are in JSON format for consistent parsing and querying
2. **Log Levels**: Standardized log levels across all services (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
3. **Contextual Information**: Each log entry includes service, trace ID, and relevant context
4. **Sensitive Data Handling**: PII and sensitive financial data are masked in logs
5. **Retention Policies**: Different retention periods based on log type and compliance requirements

### Log Types and Sources

The system generates the following types of logs:

| Log Type | Source | Format | Retention | Purpose |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Application Logs | All services | JSON | 90 days | Operational monitoring and troubleshooting |
| Audit Logs | Calculation Service, API Gateway | JSON | 7 years | Regulatory compliance and transaction history |
| System Logs | Kubernetes, infrastructure | Structured text | 30 days | Infrastructure troubleshooting |
| Access Logs | API Gateway | Combined log format | 90 days | Security monitoring and usage analysis |

Each log type has specific fields and formatting appropriate to its purpose, with standardization across similar components.

### Log Format Specification

All application logs follow a standardized JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-15T14:30:22.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "calculation-service",
  "trace_id": "0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c",
  "span_id": "b7ad6b7169203331",
  "request_id": "5e868e3e-8a0d-4093-b8ab-36b2e964a2a1",
  "message": "Calculation completed successfully",
  "client_id": "xyz789",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "additional_context": {
    "position_value": 100000,
    "loan_days": 30,
    "borrow_rate": 0.05
  }
}
```

Key fields in the log format:

1. **timestamp**: ISO 8601 format with millisecond precision
2. **level**: Log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
3. **service**: Name of the service generating the log
4. **trace_id**: OpenTelemetry trace ID for correlation
5. **span_id**: OpenTelemetry span ID for correlation
6. **request_id**: Unique identifier for the request
7. **message**: Human-readable log message
8. **additional_context**: Service-specific contextual information

This structured format enables efficient filtering, searching, and analysis of logs.

### Log Collection and Processing

Logs are collected and processed using the following components:

1. **Log Generation**:
   - Services write logs to stdout/stderr
   - Kubernetes captures container logs

2. **Log Collection**:
   - Fluent Bit DaemonSet runs on all Kubernetes nodes
   - Collects logs from all containers
   - Parses JSON logs and adds Kubernetes metadata

3. **Log Processing**:
   - Adds additional labels based on content
   - Filters sensitive information
   - Routes logs to appropriate destinations

4. **Log Storage**:
   - Loki stores logs with efficient indexing
   - S3 for long-term archival of audit logs

This pipeline ensures efficient collection, processing, and storage of logs while maintaining their integrity and security.

### Log Querying with LogQL

Loki uses LogQL for querying logs. Common query patterns include:

1. **Basic Filtering**:
   ```
   {namespace="borrow-rate-engine", service="calculation-service"}
   ```

2. **Text Search**:
   ```
   {namespace="borrow-rate-engine"} |= "ERROR"
   ```

3. **Regular Expressions**:
   ```
   {namespace="borrow-rate-engine"} |~ "error.*calculation"
   ```

4. **JSON Parsing**:
   ```
   {namespace="borrow-rate-engine"} | json | client_id="xyz789"
   ```

5. **Line Formatting**:
   ```
   {namespace="borrow-rate-engine"} | json | line_format "{{.timestamp}} {{.level}} {{.message}}"
   ```

6. **Metric Extraction**:
   ```
   sum(count_over_time({namespace="borrow-rate-engine", level="ERROR"}[5m])) by (service)
   ```

These query patterns enable efficient troubleshooting and analysis of logs across the system.

### Log-Based Alerting

In addition to metric-based alerting, the system implements log-based alerting for specific scenarios:

1. **Error Pattern Detection**:
   - Alert on specific error patterns in logs
   - Detect unusual error frequencies
   - Identify security-related log patterns

2. **Audit Log Monitoring**:
   - Alert on missing audit logs
   - Detect unusual audit log patterns
   - Monitor compliance-related log events

3. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Alert on authentication failures
   - Detect unusual access patterns
   - Monitor for potential security breaches

Example log-based alert rule:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: log_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighAuthenticationFailures
        expr: sum(count_over_time({namespace="borrow-rate-engine", service="api-gateway"} |= "authentication_failed"[5m])) > 10
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: High authentication failure rate
          description: More than 10 authentication failures in 5 minutes
```

## Distributed Tracing

This section describes the distributed tracing implementation, which provides end-to-end visibility into request flows across services.

### Tracing Architecture

The system implements distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry and Tempo:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Calc as Calculation Service
    participant Data as Data Service
    participant Ext as External API
    participant Trace as Tempo
    
    Client->>+API: Request with trace-id
    Note over API: Add span: api-request
    API->>+Calc: Forward request
    Note over Calc: Add span: calculation
    Calc->>+Data: Get market data
    Note over Data: Add span: data-fetch
    Data->>+Ext: External API call
    Note over Ext: Add span: external-call
    Ext-->>-Data: Response
    Data-->>-Calc: Return data
    Calc-->>-API: Return result
    API-->>-Client: Response
    
    API->>Trace: Export trace data
    Calc->>Trace: Export trace data
    Data->>Trace: Export trace data
```

Key components of the tracing architecture:

1. **Instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry SDK integrated into all services
2. **Context Propagation**: W3C Trace Context headers for cross-service propagation
3. **Collector**: OpenTelemetry Collector for processing and forwarding traces
4. **Storage**: Tempo for efficient trace storage and querying
5. **Visualization**: Grafana for trace visualization and analysis

### Instrumentation Approach

Services are instrumented for tracing using a combination of automatic and manual instrumentation:

1. **Automatic Instrumentation**:
   - HTTP clients and servers
   - Database clients
   - Redis clients
   - External API calls

2. **Manual Instrumentation**:
   - Critical business logic
   - Calculation functions
   - Cache operations
   - Custom error handling

3. **Span Attributes**:
   - Standard attributes: http.method, http.url, http.status_code
   - Custom attributes: client_id, ticker, position_value, loan_days
   - Error details: error.type, error.message, error.stack

This comprehensive instrumentation approach ensures visibility into all aspects of request processing.

### Sampling Strategy

Trace sampling is configured to balance observability with performance:

1. **Sampling Rules**:
   - 100% sampling for error cases (status code >= 400)
   - 100% sampling for critical endpoints (fee calculation)
   - 10% sampling for normal traffic
   - 100% sampling for specific client IDs during investigations

2. **Sampling Implementation**:
   - Head-based sampling in OpenTelemetry Collector
   - Service-specific sampling rules
   - Dynamic sampling based on traffic volume

3. **Sampling Configuration**:
```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    hash_seed: 22
    sampling_percentage: 10
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 5s
    num_traces: 100
    expected_new_traces_per_sec: 10
    policies:
      - name: error-policy
        type: status_code
        status_code:
          status_codes: [ERROR]
      - name: critical-endpoint-policy
        type: string_attribute
        string_attribute:
          key: http.url
          values: ["/api/v1/calculate-locate"]
```

This sampling strategy ensures that important traces are always captured while controlling the volume of trace data.

### Trace Analysis

Traces can be analyzed in Grafana using the following approaches:

1. **Trace Explorer**:
   - Search by trace ID
   - Filter by service, operation, duration
   - View complete trace details
   - Analyze span attributes and events

2. **Service Graph**:
   - Visualize service dependencies
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Analyze error rates between services
   - Understand request flow patterns

3. **Span Analysis**:
   - Examine individual spans
   - View span attributes and events
   - Identify slow operations
   - Understand error propagation

4. **Trace-to-Logs Correlation**:
   - Link traces to related logs
   - View logs in context of a trace
   - Correlate errors with trace events
   - Understand the complete context of a request

These analysis capabilities enable effective troubleshooting of complex, multi-service issues.

### Trace Correlation

The system implements correlation between traces, logs, and metrics:

1. **Trace-to-Logs Correlation**:
   - Trace ID and Span ID included in all log entries
   - Links from Grafana trace view to related logs
   - Ability to view logs for specific spans

2. **Trace-to-Metrics Correlation**:
   - Exemplars in Prometheus metrics link to traces
   - Ability to navigate from metric spikes to relevant traces
   - Correlation of performance metrics with trace data

3. **Correlation Implementation**:
   - W3C Trace Context propagation
   - OpenTelemetry Baggage for custom context
   - Consistent correlation IDs across all observability signals

This correlation enables seamless navigation between different observability signals, providing a complete view of system behavior.

### Trace Retention and Storage

Trace data is managed with the following retention and storage policies:

1. **Retention Periods**:
   - Standard traces: 14 days
   - Error traces: 30 days
   - Trace metadata: 90 days

2. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Tempo uses object storage (S3) for efficient storage
   - Block-based storage format for performance
   - Compaction for storage optimization

3. **Storage Efficiency**:
   - Bloom filters for efficient trace lookup
   - Index downsample for reduced storage requirements
   - Compression for reduced storage footprint

This approach balances the need for trace data availability with storage efficiency and cost considerations.

## Alerting System

This section describes the alerting system, which detects issues and notifies the appropriate teams for resolution.

### Alert Definition

Alerts are defined using Prometheus AlertManager rules. Each alert includes:

1. **Alert Name**: Clear, descriptive name
2. **Expression**: PromQL expression that triggers the alert
3. **Duration**: How long the condition must be true before alerting
4. **Labels**: Severity, service, category, team
5. **Annotations**: Summary, description, runbook link

Example alert definition:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: api_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="api-gateway", status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="api-gateway"}[5m])) > 0.01
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
          service: api-gateway
          category: availability
          team: api
        annotations:

   - Links to dashboards and runbooks

4. **SMS**:
   - Backup notification for critical alerts
   - Minimal information for urgent attention
   - Used when other channels fail

Each channel is configured with appropriate templates and formatting to provide clear, actionable information.

### Escalation Procedures

The escalation path follows this sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alert as Alert System
    participant Primary as Primary On-Call
    participant Secondary as Secondary On-Call
    participant Lead as Team Lead
    participant Manager as Engineering Manager
    
    Alert->>Primary: P1 Alert Notification
    Note over Primary: 5 minute acknowledgement window
    
    alt Primary Acknowledges
        Primary->>Alert: Acknowledge Alert
        Primary->>Primary: Begin Investigation
    else No Acknowledgement after 5 minutes
        Alert->>Secondary: Escalate Alert
        Secondary->>Alert: Acknowledge Alert
        Secondary->>Secondary: Begin Investigation
    end
    
    alt Not Resolved within 30 minutes
        Alert->>Lead: Escalate to Team Lead
        Lead->>Lead: Join Investigation
    end
    
    alt Not Resolved within 60 minutes
        Alert->>Manager: Escalate to Manager
        Manager->>Manager: Initiate Incident Command
    end
```

| Role | Responsibilities | Escalation Timeframe |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| Primary On-Call | Initial response and troubleshooting | Acknowledge within 5 minutes |
| Secondary On-Call | Backup for primary | Engaged after 5 minutes of no response |
| Team Lead | Technical guidance and resource coordination | Engaged after 30 minutes for P1/P2 |
| Engineering Manager | Stakeholder communication and incident command | Engaged after 60 minutes for P1 |

This escalation procedure ensures that alerts are addressed promptly and that additional resources are engaged when needed.

### Alert Thresholds

Alert thresholds are defined based on service level objectives (SLOs) and operational experience:

| Metric | Warning (P3) | High (P2) | Critical (P1) |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| API Success Rate | <99.5% for 5min | <99% for 5min | <98% for 2min |
| Response Time | >150ms for 10min | >250ms for 5min | >500ms for 2min |
| External API Errors | >1% for 15min | >5% for 5min | >10% for 2min |
| Database Latency | >50ms for 15min | >100ms for 5min | >200ms for 2min |
| Cache Hit Rate | <90% for 30min | <80% for 15min | <70% for 5min |

Thresholds are regularly reviewed and adjusted based on operational experience and changing requirements. The goal is to minimize false positives while ensuring that real issues are detected promptly.

1. **Retention Policies**:
   - Metrics: 30 days in Prometheus, 1 year downsampled
   - Logs: 90 days in Loki, 7 years for audit logs
   - Traces: 14 days in Tempo, 30 days for error traces

2. **Retention Monitoring**:
   - Storage usage tracking
   - Retention policy enforcement
   - Archival process monitoring
   - Data access after archival

3. **Retention Alerting**:
   - Storage capacity warnings
   - Retention policy violations
   - Archival process failures
   - Data access issues

Effective data retention monitoring ensures that data is retained as required for compliance while managing storage costs and performance.
