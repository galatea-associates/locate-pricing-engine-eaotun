External Services Test Package

This package contains tests for the external service integrations including:
- SecLend API client for borrow rates
- Market Volatility API client for volatility metrics
- Event Calendar API client for event risk factors

Tests in this package verify:
1. Proper integration with external APIs
2. Correct handling of API responses
3. Appropriate fallback mechanisms when external services are unavailable
4. Accurate data transformation from external formats to internal models

This init file makes the test package importable and may expose common test 
utilities, fixtures, or mocks shared across multiple test modules.
